# Introduction

This is a single page application that simply shows the current Epoch time when the button is pressed.

# Explanation of approach

Just creating a HTML file that contains the Javascript to handle the updating of the time when the button is pressed seemed the simplest, so that's what I did.

# Usage/How to Test

The app.html file can be served using any web server or just opened in a web browser. To update the time, simply click the "Click here" button.
